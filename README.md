Project Features:

Features One: You can see i have already have created cards by using API. I added a select button in the all card. if anyone click the select button, we can see that course title are added on the right side of the carts which is course name.

Features Two: If someone clicked select button more then once then it shows that 'You cant take more than one course'.

Features Three: I added the "reaminig creadits" features here.If anyone takes more then 20 credits, browser will sweetly alert him that 'You cant take more than 20 credit'. Its a very interesting features.

A discussion about how I managed the state in my assignment project:

=>In my assignment project, I effectively managed state using "React's" useState hook. I utilized it to create and control states for various aspects, including 'courses', which stored course data, 'selectItem' for selected items, 'remaining' to track the remaining count, and 'total' to set an initial value of 20. These states played a crucial role in maintaining the application's functionality and providing a dynamic user experience.
